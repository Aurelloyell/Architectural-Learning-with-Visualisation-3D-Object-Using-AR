![Header](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12345678/123456789-abcdef.png) <!-- Replace with a relevant header image URL -->

ARsitektur is an innovative mobile application built with Flutter, designed to provide an immersive and interactive architectural learning experience. This app combines rich educational content with Augmented Reality (AR) technology to visualize 3D architectural models in the real world.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Educational Architectural Content**: Explore a wide range of architectural topics, from fundamental principles and historic styles like Gothic, to modern and sustainable concepts. Each topic is presented with concise and easy-to-understand explanations.
* **Interactive 3D Model Gallery**: View various 3D architectural models directly within the app. Users can rotate and zoom in on models to inspect every detail.
* **Augmented Reality (AR) Visualization**: Bring 3D models to life in your own environment using AR technology. This feature provides a better understanding of scale and form by placing virtual objects in the real world.
* **Clean and Intuitive Interface**: Designed with a focus on user experience, the app is easy to navigate, ensuring an enjoyable learning process.
* **Multi-Platform Support**: Built with Flutter, this application can run on Android, iOS, Web, and Desktop from a single codebase.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

* **Framework**: Flutter
* **Language**: Dart
* **3D & AR Visualization**: `model_viewer_plus`
* **State Management**: StatefulWidgets (for local UI)
